## About me
I am a Senior Bioinformatics Scientist in the lab of Ryan Roberts (https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/research/areas-of-research/center-for-childhood-cancer/roberts-lab/lab-staff) in the Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, USA. We study the process of metastasis in pediatric osteosarcoma with the goal of finding new therapies that can improve patient outcomes.

I have a background studying a broad range of biological topics, though the common throughline has always been sequencing. During my undergraduate studies I worked in two different labs doing Sanger sequencing on hornworts and the rat Sry geneMy PhD work focused on mitochondrial biology and included primariy molecular biology and mouse modeling work. I taught myself the basics of next-gen sequence analysis during this time. Following this I started a postdoc in a group at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute under Dr. David Serre where I recieved formal training in bioinformatics and genomics. I applied these skills to many different topics and followed David to the University of Maryland, Baltimore's Institute for Genome Sciences to continue this work. I moved to the Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Nationwide Children's Hospital in 2021.

## Miscellaneous

My hobbies share the same diversity as my scientific career. I grew up being exposed to a lot of interesting things and took up a bunch of random hobbies off and on. I have worked on restoring antique tractors, motorcyles and motors. I used to ride dirtbikes and do hill climbing. I did annual motorcycle trips with my dad where we would ride random back roads for a week. I helped/watched my dad to a lot of machining over the years including using a lathe, mill and lots of filing, sanding and polishing. I helped my dad hew a log to fix a collapsed wall in a cabin from the 1800s in southern Ohio, during which I found a rusted handgun buried under the cabin. I also helped him pull an enormous oak log out of a swamp, which required us to hook two of his trackors up in tandem to get it out. I have done blacksmithing and bladesmithing. I raised show pigeons (show racers) and attended a lot of pigeon shows over the years, even judging once. I drove a John Deer Model H in tractor pulls for a few years. I've done woodworking and helped my dad run the sawmill he built. I taught myself to build computers and fix them when I inevitably messed up them up. I have done hiking and a bit of camping, hunting and fishing. I worked in a greenhouse for around seven years and once raised Japanese maple trees from seedlings until I sold them as pre-bonsai. I tinker with the piano a bit, inspired by my grandfather. My grandfather exposed me to a lot of science growing up and was a real inspiration for me to go into science (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_L._Crabill). I did fencing for several years, including both olympic fencing as well as renaissance style fencing (more freeform, I mostly liked sword and dagger). I swam competatively in high school and was best at backstroke. I can't do the butterfly stroke to save my life. I climbed *almost* all the way up Mt. St. Helens. I lived in a crappy, half broke-down trailer way out in the woods of Alabama for four years and it was awesome. I have built several 3D printers including two Prusas, a Railcore and a Voron. I do 3D modeling, primarily using Fusion 360 and I'm trying to pick up Blender.
